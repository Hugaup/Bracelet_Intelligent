# 🩺 Smart Bracelet for Early Sepsis Detection

This project aims to develop a **wearable medical device** that helps detect early signs of **sepsis** by analysing abnormal patient movements (e.g., tremors, chills), which may indicate neurological distress before any vital threats.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Detect early indicators of sepsis through motion analysis.
- **Methodology:** Use accelerometer and gyroscope data to identify unusual movement patterns through signal processing and machine learning.
- **Medical Partner:** Dr. Pierre Jacquet, Hôpital de Saint-Denis

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📊 Motion data processing pipeline (Python, Jupyter)
- 🎚️ Signal filtering (Butterworth low-pass filter)
- 📈 Frequency-domain analysis (FFT)
- 🤖 Machine Learning models tested:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM, which through testing proved to be the best)
- 🛡️ Designed for hospital use but still in prototype phase

## 📌 Status

- ✅ Motion detection pipeline implemented
- ✅ Feature extraction and ML classification operational
- 🧪 Hardware prototype design conceptualised
- 🔐 Secure data transfer and compliance roadmap defined

## 👥 Team

- Project in collaboration with **Dr. Pierre Jacquet**
- VENTURA Francesco Ali, STIOUI Allison, TOUCHEBOEUF Virgil, AUPERIN Hugo
